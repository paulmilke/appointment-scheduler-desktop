# appointment-scheduler-desktop
I'm currently fixing the database connection to use my newly created AWS RDS. I should have that up and running this week (March 7), and should allow you to download the project and run it locally on your Windows desktop. I'll post an update to this README file when I have that up and running. Cheers!
